        <h1>This is My Life</h1>
        <p>My name is <strong>Victor Ronnuel David</strong>. I am 22 years old and was born on <strong>January 30, 2003</strong>, in <strong>Pusok, Cemento, Lapu-Lapu City</strong>. Since childhood, I have loved repairing things and experimenting with DC motors, batteries, and speakers.</p>
        <p>As I grew up, I developed my skills and became a <strong>cellphone and laptop technician</strong>. Being a technician is very challenging because even a small mistake can lead to big problems. However, that is part of the job. One of the things I love about this profession is that I can earn <strong>₱600 to ₱1,000+</strong> in just a minute, which is really rewarding! Hahaha!</p>   
        <p>Due to a lack of customers in my repair business, I decided to work part-time as a <strong>bartender</strong> at <strong>Uncle Brew</strong>. Even though the salary is only <strong>₱63 per hour</strong>, the work is not as difficult compared to my previous job in fast food.</p>
        <p>From 2017 to 2023, I also worked in fast food as a part-timer. Currently, I work from <strong>Monday to Saturday for 5 hours</strong>, earning <strong>₱315 per day</strong>. On Sundays, I work <strong>8 hours</strong> and earn <strong>₱501</strong>.</p>

        <p>I work hard because I want to earn more money and secure my future. Now, I have a <strong>Cebuana Bank</strong> account where I deposit my salary. I also set aside some of my earnings for my daily expenses and education.</p>
        
        <p>This is my life, and I am proud of my journey so far.</p>
